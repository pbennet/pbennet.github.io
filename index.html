								<h2>Research</h2>
								<p> My research focuses on dwarf galaxies, both within the Local Group and beyond. </p>

							<h3>I. Detecting Dwarf Galaxies</h3>
							
							<p>The Λ CDM model is currently our best model for the Universe, 
							containing both dark matter and dark energy, in addition to regular matter. 
							The study of dwarf galaxies, particularly low-mass and low surface brightness 
							dwarfs provides a new avenue to gain information as to where and 
							why the Λ CDM model breaks down.</p> 

							<p>I developed a semi-automated algorithm to detect low surface brightness galaxies 
							using CFHTLS data. This allows us to search for unresolved LSB galaxies in optical 
							images across a variety of different environments such as galaxy clusters, groups of 
							Galaxies and in the field. This search led to the discovery of 38 new LSB candidates, 
							far more than the 11 found by previous visually led searches.</p> 

							<p>Observations of LSB dwarf galaxies and the stars within them allow us to determine 
							the properties of the dark matter halos that host these galaxies. This provides  
							strict constraints on and tests of cosmological and galactic evolutionary theories, 
							allowing us to make significant progress on the problems within the ΛCDM model. </p>

							<h3>II. Proper Motions</h3>
								
							<p>I also study the proper motions of dwarf galaxies within the Local Group. 
							By examining the kinematics of these dwarf galaxies, and linking their orbital and 
							star formation histories we can better understand the properties of their hosts. </p>

							<p>The mass of the Local Group, both as a whole and its individual components, 
							continues to be an open question. Answering this question is also key to comparing 
							observations and simulations to determine whether the ‘missing satellites problem’ has 
							indeed been solved. </p>

							<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/~marel/hstpromo.html">HSTPROMO</a> group at STScI, 
							I contributed to the development of a 
							software tool, GaiaHub. This tool combines the longer observing history and greater 
							sensitivity of the Hubble Space Telescope with the all sky coverage offered by Gaia 
							to determine the proper motions of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies that would not 
							be possible with the individual telescopes. </p>

							<p>I have led work that used this this tool to determine the kinematics of the globular 
							clusters in the Magellanic clouds, and show that they have substantial differences to 
							those of the Milky Way or M31.</p>
